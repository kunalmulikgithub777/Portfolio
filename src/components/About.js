      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm <strong>Kunal Mulik</strong>, a passionate <strong>Full Stack Web Developer</strong> with a focus on building modern, scalable, and secure web applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        My core stack includes <strong>Java (Spring Boot)</strong> for backend development and <strong>React.js</strong> for dynamic, responsive frontend interfaces. I have experience designing RESTful APIs, managing databases with MySQL, and deploying applications with tools like Netlify and Vercel.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm committed to writing clean, efficient code and continuously improving my skills. Whether itâ€™s creating interactive UIs or building robust backend systems, I love bringing ideas to life through code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond coding, I enjoy learning about system design, exploring new tech trends, and sharing knowledge with the developer community.
      </p>
